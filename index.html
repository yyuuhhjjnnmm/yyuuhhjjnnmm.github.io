                        <br>
                        My name is Viktor and I am a current Master's of Science Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. Before this, I graduated from the Univeristy of Waterloo, where
                        I completed my Bachelor's of Mathematics Honours Computer Science.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Besides from writing long commit messages and forgetting semicolons,
                         I enjoy talking horology
                         and watches, and also have a keen interest in men's fashion.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        Additionally, I like to live a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy powerlifting,
                        olympic weightlifting, bicycling, swimming and running. I have played rugby since 2011,
                        not only that, but it is also one of my favourite sports to watch.

                        <br>
                        Aside from excercise, I also love wasting time by watching TV shows, 
                        and am one of
                        the oldest proponent of bringing 'Person of Interest' back for 
                        a sixth season.

                        <br>
                        Finally I have an amateur interest in personal finance and
                        investing. I have devoted so much time listening to podcasts
                        about market betas and volatility, and reading books
                        about the firm foundation theory, that I am a bit suprised I have
                        time to do anything else.

                <h3>Nielsen: Global Connect</h3>
                <h4>Software Developer</h4>
                <p>
                At Nielsen, I worked in the Canadian Technology Department, on the team responsbile for rewriting the old core calculation engine. While on that team, I contributed to various parts of the project:<br><br>
                   
                1. <b><u>Data Preprocessing Program</u></b><br>
                This application took the existing underlying data pipeline and eliminated the numerous files from the old workflow. This was achieved by aggregating the data into a single JSON file to be taken as input by the new calculation engine. Due to the C++ dominate workflow, the POCO JSON library was used to format the resulting JSON. Within the preprocessing, additional logic was added in order to streamline the downstream calcualtion and optimize process time.<br><br>
                    
                2. <b><u>New Core Calculation Engine</u></b><br>
                The new calculation engine was designed to replace the old engine's functionaility, but improving the design with Object-Oriented design and leveraging the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern in order to reduce the runtime cost of by implementing static polymorphism. <br><br>
                    
                In order to benchmark the performance, we used linux tools such as perf stat and gprof to benchmark the CPU time and to get a breakdown of hotspots. Simiialry, using Visual Studio 2019 disagonitc tools, the CPU usage and CPU time was used to get a benchmark of performance.<br><br>
                
                3. <b><u>Python Scripts</u></b><br>
                On the Linux servers, we developed and maintained Python scripts in order to run test orders for testing the complete order flow, the correctness of our new calculation engine compared to the old, and also to benchmark the performance of our new engine.<br><br>
                    
                4. <b><u>Sybase Investigation</u></b><br>
                During development, we realized that even though our intermediary results matched with the old engine, our end to end testing showed discrepencies. I was tasked with tracking down the source of this error. I proceeded by manually running all the programs in the pipeline and comparing intermediary Sybase tables using SQL. Here I was able to backtrace the root cause of the mismatch, and by investigating the SQL stored-procedures of the downstream programs, I was able to determine the reason for the problem. One of the files that the old engine was producing was actually required by downstream programs, thus we implemented the required functionailty to support that file and were able to resolve this problem.<br>

                <h3>Scotiabank</h3>
                <h4>Software Developer</h4>
                <p>
                At Scotiabank, I worked in the 
                <a href= "https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/en.html" target="_blank">
                Global Banking and Markets (GBM) </a>
                division, with the Global Analytics and Financial Engineering (GAFE) 
                team.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my time with GAFE, I worked on two distinct projects:<br>
                1. <b><u>Develop an Object Oriented data handling system in Python</u></b>
                <br>
                Due to new 
                <a href = "https://www.isda.org/" target="_blank">ISDA
                </a>regulations, Scotibank needed to a new methodology in 
                order to comply with the Standard Initial Margin Model (SIMM). Previously,
                a proof-of-concept was developed for the core calculations. In order to
                test the existing solution, the GAFE team was tasked to develop a pipeline
                for the data flowing through, extract relevant trade information and to
                feed the subset of data through the calculator. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This aggregation and scripting was done through populating our own
                <b>Object-Oriented</b> data structure with Python scripts. Our group used 
                <b>BitBucket</b> for revision control and peer review. Throughout the project, our team
                was able to <u>reduce the processing time of over one million trade entries
                by more than 400% </u>by minimizing I/O to file, while still considering space,
                time and security tradeoffs.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <b><u>Develop new portfolio functionality in C++</u></b>
                <br>
                One of the softwares used by internal traders at Scotiabank is 
                <a href = "https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS218-468/index.html&lang=&request_locale=en" target="_blank">
                IBM Algo One.</a>
                This is an enterprise software solution developed by IBM. The core code
                of the software is developed in <b>C++</b> and is an <b>Object-Oriented Program</b>. 
                <br><br>
                One of the departments requested GAFE to integrate new portfolio functionalities 
                for the software. Thus I was tasked with developing code to handle new
                portfolio dynamics. Alongside the implementation, I also wrote
                <b>Bash Shell</b> scripts to retrieve archived market data for testing.
                Furthermore, I added a new test suite to the existing <u>daily overnight regression 
                testing</u> system. Finally, to accompany the changes,
                I composed a technical manual detailing sample useage and implementation
                specifics.
