                        Currently based in Toronto, Canada.<br>
                        Currently working at Nielsen as a Software Developer.<br>
                        <br>
                        My name is Viktor and I am a graduate from the Univeristy of Waterloo, where
                        I completed my Bachelor's of Mathematics (Computer Science) April 2019.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Besides from writing long commit messages and forgetting semicolons,
                         I like to think that I have some hobbies. I enjoy talking horology
                         and watches, but also have a keen interest in men's fashion
                         and styling in general.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        Additionally, I like to live a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy powerlifting,
                        olympic lifting, bicycling, swimming and running. I have played rugby for the last eight years. 
                        Not only that, but it is also one of my favourite sports to watch.
                         
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Aside from excercise, I also love wasting time by watching TV shows, 
                        and am one of
                        the oldest proponent of bringing Person of Interest back for 
                        a sixth season.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally I have an amateur interest in personal finance and 
                        investing. I have devoted so much time listening to podcasts
                        about market betas and volatility, and reading books
                        about the firm foundation theory, that I am a bit suprised I have
                        time to do anything else.

                        Please have a look around my personal website, and get in touch about jobs, watches, personal finance,

                <h3>Scotiabank</h3>
                <h4>Software Developer & Analyst (Contract)</h4>
                <p>
                At Scotiabank, I worked in the 
                <a href= "https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/en.html" target="_blank">
                Global Banking and Markets (GBM) </a>
                division with the Global Analytics and Financial Engineering (GAFE) 
                group.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my time with GAFE, I worked on two distinct projects:<br>
                1. <b><u>Develop an Object Oriented data handling system in Python</u></b>
                <br>
                Due to new 
                <a href = "https://www.isda.org/" target="_blank">ISDA
                </a>regulations, Scotibank needed to a new methodology in 
                order to comply with the Standard Initial Margin Model (SIMM). Previously,
                a proof-of-concept was developed for the core calculations. In order to
                test the existing solution, the GAFE team was tasked to develop a pipeline
                for the data flowing through, extract relevant trade information and to
                feed the subset of data through the calculator. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This aggregation and scripting was done through populating our own
                <b>Object-Oriented</b> data structure with Python scripts. Our group used 
                <b>BitBucket</b> for revision control and peer review. Throughout the project, our team
                was able to <u>reduce the processing time of over one million trade entries
                by more than 400% </u>by minimizing I/O to file, while still considering space,
                time and security tradeoffs.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <b><u>Develop new portfolio functionality in C++</u></b>
                <br>
                One of the softwares used by internal traders at Scotiabank is 
                <a href = "https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS218-468/index.html&lang=&request_locale=en" target="_blank">
                IBM Algo One.</a>
                This is an enterprise software solution developed by IBM. The core code
                of the software is developed in <b>C++</b> and is an <b>Object-Oriented Program</b>. 
                <br><br>
                One of the departments requested GAFE to integrate new portfolio functionalities 
                for the software. Thus I was tasked with developing code to handle new
                portfolio dynamics. Alongside the implementation, I also wrote
                <b>Bash Shell</b> scripts to parse live market data for testing.
                Furthermore, I added a new test suite to the existing <u>daily overnight regression 
                testing</u> system. Finally, to accompany the changes,
                I composed a technical manual detailing sample usuage and implementation
                specifics.
