class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">INTRODUCTION</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Ever since 2009, when Uber came on to the scene, the world has embraced ride hailing apps (RHA). While young RHA startups like Uber and Lyft grew, they captured market share by addressing the existing issues of taking taxis, which helped them explode into popularity. However, as their business grew, a nasty side effect of the fast, loosely regulated expansion came to light. Week after week, it seemed that reports of scandalous incidents ranging from verbal harassment and physical assault to rape and even murder became a regular occurence. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In Uber&#39;s first safety report released in November 2019, Uber reported about three thousand sexual assaults out of their 1.3 billions rides in the USA in 2018. The New York Times (NYT) compared that to the NYPD&#39;s report of 533 sex crimes on the NY transit system, out of 1.6 billion rides in 2018. The NYT article drew a stark contrast between the two transportation platforms with similar riderships. (</span><span class="c9"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703756000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1r8br9hIz58PIAbwbZCeWa">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html</a></span><span class="c0">) Although public transit has a different dynamic than taking a private ride, 6 times the number of sexual assault is unacceptable.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Given the numbers, it is clear that RHA are not doing enough to protect their passengers. In this essay, I suggest three areas of improvement:</span></p><ol class="c11 lst-kix_1v622db7pd0j-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2"><span class="c0">their pre-screening procedure, as a preventative measure</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">their in-ride safety feature, to help safety during rides, and </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">their handling of complaints, after an incident has occurred</span></li></ol><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">These three points cover the entire timeline of a user&#39;s experience, from before the ride, during the ride and after the incident after a ride. This multifaceted approach should help RHA promote safety by addressing and preventing more occurrences of criminal incidents during rides.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">BEFORE RIDES: IMPROVE SCREENING</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Over the past few years, RHA such as Uber and Lyft have been at the forefront of scandalous incidents. A few recent examples include:</span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_bel8hddaycdr-0 start"><li class="c2"><span class="c0">a sexual assault incident of a female Los Angeles passanger in 2017</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">a sexual assault by a Seattle Uber driver in 2018, and </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">a kidnapping and rape of a female passanger by a New Orleans Lyft driver in 2019</span></li></ul><p class="c10"><span class="c4">(</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ankinlaw.com/rideshare-services-safety/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703757000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vcUFdabAp8AjBzuBdTBOP">https://ankinlaw.com/rideshare-services-safety/</a></span><span class="c0">) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">It is clear that there is a subset of RHA drivers who have criminal intent, and the RHA companies need to do a better job preventing them from exploiting their platforms.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Massachusetts, a 2016 law requires RHA drivers to be further screened by the state before being able to drive passengers. In an article by WHDH, a local Boston Massachusetts news station, it is reported that the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities rejected nearly 16% of applicants that passed the initial background checks by the RHA companies in 2018. Out of the rejected applicants, &quot;more than 5,000 applicants were rejected due to a past violent crime or because they are registered sex offenders&quot;. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">(</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whdh.com/news/mass-dept-of-public-utilities-more-than-30000-ride-sharing-applicants-rejected-in-2018/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703758000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Ej0uNvwZq4a52HusLNgY6">https://whdh.com/news/mass-dept-of-public-utilities-more-than-30000-ride-sharing-applicants-rejected-in-2018/</a></span><span class="c4">) According to the Ankin Law Office, it is clear that &quot;... Uber and Lyft routinely fail to perform adequate background checks on drivers and fail to monitor drivers for inappropriate conduct after they are hired&quot;. (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ankinlaw.com/rideshare-services-safety/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703758000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OLUnUmaeYB_N_LnjvdKWm">https://ankinlaw.com/rideshare-services-safety/</a></span><span class="c0">) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Since 2018, RHA have committed to more stringent background checks, including criminal, driving and sexual registry, and the industry wide standard of annual rescreening. However, it is clear that these companies need to continue to improve on their hiring practice. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Connecticut Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal was quoted saying that &ldquo;... these ride-hailing companies have been abjectly failing in their duty to protect against predators or criminals&rdquo;. The senator has also been an advocate of more stringent background checks, including fingerprint based biometric background checks (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703759000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1nYTbr0GnRLXLsO86rL141">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html</a></span><span class="c4">), which is a sentiment shared by other law officials as well.

Furthermore, they also need to consistently reassess drivers, possibly more than the current industry standard of annual re-screening.

The audio recordings were mandatory, encrypted, and would get deleted after seven days if there were no complaints. The company has stood by this measure, proposing it as a deterrent for crimes during RHA rides due to surveillance and the resulting evidence.

Uber will first pilot audio recording in smaller markets, and later will roll-out the feature to the US after successful testing. The article also described the backlash the company has received over this, as privacy concerns about illegal wiretap, eavesdropping and privacy concerns have been brought up.

Michael Bomberger, the San Diego-based lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf of 19 women against Lyft, &quot;said the company needed to do far more, like installing video and audio surveillance that would let drivers know they are being recorded.&quot;(</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703762000&amp;usg=AOvVaw24Ww569JUZ3meRZOUhSpxA">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">AFTER INCIDENT: COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">After all the pre-emptive procedures and in-ride safety features, there are still bound to be incidents. When these inevitable incidents seep through the crack, RHA need to support criminal investigations instead of impeding it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In the 19 women lawsuit against Lyft, &quot;the women allege that Lyft &#39;chooses to stonewall&#39; law enforcement investigating assaults.&quot; (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703762000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38-qGGouv9yjkLIQlPxy8j">https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html</a></span><span class="c0">)</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">According to a Reuters article studying the 2019 Uber safety report, a similar sentiment towards law enforcement can be found with Uber. From the article, Reuters explained that &quot;Uber &hellip; received nearly 22,000 requests from U.S. law enforcement for user account details in 2018 and produced at least some data in 72% of the cases.&quot; The extent of &quot;at least some data&quot; is not clear, and the fact that in 28% of cases Uber failed to provide any data is jaw-dropping. It is evident that RHA companies are reluctant to fully cooperate with police when it comes to releasing private information. (</span><span class="c9"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-safety-drivers-focus/ubers-challenge-to-balance-driver-safety-with-customer-privacy-idUSKBN20X187&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703763000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14LUakVkk0DZGlUkFB1Rnq">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-safety-drivers-focus/ubers-challenge-to-balance-driver-safety-with-customer-privacy-idUSKBN20X187</a></span><span class="c0">)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">In defense of the RHA companies, they need to protect sensitive user data. Here, we are yet again faced with the balance of safety and privacy, similar to the question of audio recording. Although individual privacy rights are crucial and a foundational part of basic rights, the police cannot conduct proper investigations when the RHA are withholding critical information about the alleged assailant. The RHA companies need to cooperate better with police departments and find a suitable middleground, in order to ensure safety and that offenders are properly charged.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">CONCLUSION</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">It is clear that RHA have come a long way since their start in the early 2010s. With greater awareness from the general public, these companies have faced pressure to improve safety for the users of their apps. These external pressures have resulted in stricter and more frequency background checkers, better in-app safety features, public education campaigns, and more. The Uber 2019 Safety Report was a groundbreaking step forward, leading the industry in transparency and could be seen as a genuine step towards making a safer platform.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">As Jeanne Christensen, a lawyer of rape victims during Uber rides, said: &ldquo;the more that the public is aware, the more the company and everyone else has to respond&rdquo;. These responses need to put safety as priority because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s [RHA] such a part of daily life that everyone is going to take it. We&rsquo;re already at that point. So now they just have to make it as safe as possible.&rdquo; (Jeanne Christensen) (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1594605703764000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1MxQM3SMxpUiJO9xCdI1oj">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/technology/uber-sexual-assaults-murders-deaths-safety.html</a></span><span class="c4">)</span></p></body></html>
